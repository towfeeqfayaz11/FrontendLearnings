<!--

Let’s walk through this step-by-step to understand what happens when you submit the form in forms.html and how the data is displayed on results.html.

Step 1: Form Submission in forms.html
In your forms.html file, you have a form defined as follows:

html
Copy code
<form action="results.html" method="GET">
action="results.html":

This attribute tells the browser where to send the form data when you submit it.
Here, it’s set to "results.html", so when you submit the form, the browser navigates to results.html and sends the form data to this page.
method="GET":

The method="GET" attribute specifies how the data will be sent.
With GET, the form data is appended to the URL as query parameters.
When you submit the form, the URL might look something like this:
vbnet
Copy code
results.html?userName=John&userPassword=secret&userEmail=john%40email.com&userAge=30&date=1995-12-15&banana=on&gender=MALE
Each form field name is paired with its value, joined by &.
Step 2: Navigating to results.html
Once you click "Submit" in forms.html, the browser goes to results.html and passes the form data through the URL. Now results.html receives this data, which is part of the URL as query parameters. For example:

vbnet
Copy code
results.html?userName=John&userPassword=secret&userEmail=john%40email.com&userAge=30&date=1995-12-15&banana=on&gender=MALE
Step 3: Processing Data in results.html
In results.html, you have this <script> section that handles displaying the data:

html
Copy code
<script>
    const resultsList = document.getElementById('results')
    new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).forEach((value, name) => {
        resultsList.append(`${name}: ${value}`)
        resultsList.append(document.createElement('br'))
    })
</script>
Here’s a breakdown of what this code does:

window.location.search:

This part gets the query string from the URL, which is everything after the ?.
For example, window.location.search might return:
perl
Copy code
"?userName=John&userPassword=secret&userEmail=john%40email.com&userAge=30&date=1995-12-15&banana=on&gender=MALE"
new URLSearchParams(window.location.search):

URLSearchParams is a JavaScript object that helps parse and handle query parameters.
new URLSearchParams(window.location.search) turns the query string into a more manageable form, allowing us to loop through each key-value pair.
forEach((value, name) => { ... }):

forEach goes through each key-value pair (parameter name and value) in the query string.
For each pair, it executes the code inside the curly braces { ... }.
resultsList.append(${name}: ${value}):

resultsList is a reference to the <div> element with id="results", where we want to display the data.
resultsList.append(${name}: ${value}) adds text like userName: John or userEmail: john@email.com directly to the resultsList element.
Adding a Line Break:

resultsList.append(document.createElement('br')) creates a <br> element (a line break) after each entry, so each key-value pair appears on a new line.
Example Output on results.html
If you submitted the form with the following values:

Name: John
Password: secret
Email: john@email.com
Age: 30
BirthDate: 1995-12-15
Favorite Foods: Banana
Gender: Male
After submitting, results.html would display the data like this:

vbnet
Copy code
userName: John
userPassword: secret
userEmail: john@email.com
userAge: 30
date: 1995-12-15
banana: on
gender: MALE
Summary
Submit the form: When you click "Submit" in forms.html, the form data is sent to results.html as part of the URL (because of method="GET").
Process the URL: In results.html, JavaScript code reads and processes the query parameters.
Display the data: Each form field’s name and value are displayed on the page inside the #results <div>, formatted as name: value on separate lines.
